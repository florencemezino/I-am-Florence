### Design

* Colour Scheme
The two main colours used for this project are `color 1` and `color 2`. 
The background color is  white or light gray, or dark gray or black background`.

* Typography
The `Roboto` font is the main font used throughout the whole website with `Sans Serif` as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. 
Roboto is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate for this portfolio project. It has a techy, machine-like feel to it. The wide-open characters also give it a friendly touch.

* Imagery
Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.
